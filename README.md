BlitzCraft
==========

A python framework for crafting bots to play Bejeweled Blitz

Intended Use
============

While writing my own bot for playing Bejeweled Blitz in the browser, it
occurred to me that this task could be highly educational to new python
programmers. In composing this repo, I hope to provide something which could be
used by educators and autodidacts as a tool for learning basic concepts in
python, OS-interaction, and game logic. Although fully-featured bots will be
available, tinkering and building new methods is absolutely encouraged.
